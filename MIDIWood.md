# Abstract
[Please insert here a short description, within 200-300 words, of your project]
Our idea for this project is to build a creative installation. The aim is to traduce in a painting and in a sound the hit of some objects on a board made of wood. The user is provided with the board on top of a piezoelectric sensor and some objects (e.g. pencil, ball, fork, sponge). He/She will interact with the board by hitting it with the given objects. Depending on the object that has been used, the hits will generate different vibrations that are collected by the sensor and transformed into MIDI signals by a VST that separates the different types of signals by their frequency range, e.g. the fork will enhance more high frequency on the board, that will be recognized by the VST and an opportune MIDI message will be sent to the software. 
This makes it possible to recognize the different objects used. The different MIDI signals are then associated to a different figure or a painting style and the final result will be a full picture generated by the kicks of the different objects. The painting will be the result also of the different strikes given by the user: there will be evaluated the strength of the impact together with the surface of the used object. At the same time, a music will be created by evaluating the feature of the painting: colors, saturation, the harshness of the brush stroke.


## Artistic vision
[Insert here a short description of the artistic vision of your project. What is your audience target? What is the artistic idea you want to convey? The vision can change during the project, but it is important you have one before starting to code]
## Prototype after the hackathon
_Your project should start with a prototype that will implement only the very basic functionalities of your project, and it will serve as a "proof of concept" of your vision._
[Please insert there a bullet point description of the basic functionalities you expect to implement for the first part]
The dummy version that we expect to present in the first commit is characterized by a simply wood board with only one sensor that captures the vibration. Then the signal will be elaborated by a VST to distinguish the different types of object. The drawing associated with the strike is simple as the music played (only few characteristics of the signal are used to implement both). The music played is function only of the paint and it's not in real time.

# Final project
[Please insert here a bullet point description of the functionalities you expect to implement for the final presentation of the project. This description is a draft and will serve for the teacher to help you find the right dimension (i.e., number and type of functionalities) for the poroject] 
The last version is a direct extension of the first one, more sensors are used, also to catch position of the striking point. The visualization takes count of different parameters arriving from the sensor, e.g. velocity, attack are used to draw the painting. The sonification is function of the paint, but also of direct interaction of the user (the sensor is used to draw and at the same time gives feedback on the sonification structure and make it change simultanely)
